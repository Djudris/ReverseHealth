        "faq-question-1": "What is Wellinda?",

        "faq-question-2": "Why do I need to use supplements?",
        "faq-answer-2": "A dietary supplement adds essential nutrients that might be hard to obtain from regular diet alone. For instance, in winter, when sunlight exposure is limited, vitamin D supplementation becomes necessary. Similarly, while collagen is available in small quantities from food, taking specific doses via supplements can notably benefit skin and joint health. Wellindaâ€™s approach is simple, fix your diet first then consider supplements.",
