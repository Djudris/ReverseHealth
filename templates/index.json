        "faq-question-1": "What is Wellinda?",
        "faq-answer-1": "We are a women's wellness brand dedicated to supporting all stages of menopause, foundational health, and graceful aging. With our deep understanding of the complex symptoms and challenges of menopause, we offer targeted relief through evidence-based supplements and holistic health protocols. Each ingredient is included at an efficacious dosage, rigorously tested for safety and potency. Wellinda products are designed to empower women to achieve optimal vitality and wellbeing.",
        "faq-question-2": "Why do I need to use supplements?",
        "faq-answer-2": "Supplements provide essential nutrients that are difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities from food alone, especially during life stages such as menopause. For instance, Collagen supplements can help offset the decline in natural collagen production during menopause, offering notable benefits for skin and joint health. While Protein supplements are a practical and convenient way to increase total protein intake, which is known to benefit weight loss, muscle tone and hormonal balance. Wellinda’s supplements, including those specifically for menopause, offer an added layer of support and relief, enhancing overall wellbeing without solely relying on dietary changes. Our Evidence-based products are designed to complement your lifestyle, ensuring optimal health and graceful aging.",
        "faq-question-3": "Are there any side effects?",
        "faq-answer-3": "While our products are designed with a focus on safety and are based on natural ingredients, individual reactions can vary.  Most, if not all, of the products we sell are composed of natural ingredients that can be obtained from targeted diets. We recommend consulting with a healthcare professional before beginning any new supplement regimen, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, have existing health conditions, or are taking other medications.",
        "faq-question-4": "What kind of quality controls do you have?",
        "faq-answer-4": "We uphold the highest standards of quality control through meticulous evaluation of our product development and manufacturing processes. Each product is manufactured in facilities that are committed to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), ensuring compliance with the most stringent quality guidelines. Our facilities are not only NSF certified but also adhere to FDA regulations, highlighting our dedication to safety and excellence. To reinforce our commitment to quality, we conduct extensive third-party testing for purity and potency, guaranteeing that our customers receive products of the highest integrity and effectiveness.",
        "faq-question-5": "Who should use Wellinda supplements?",
        "faq-answer-5": "Wellinda supplements are meticulously crafted to support women during perimenopause, menopause, and post-menopause, paving the way for improved health, wellbeing, and graceful aging. Our products are tailored to address the unique needs of women during these transformative stages, ensuring they can embrace each phase with strength and vitality.",
        "faq-question-6": "How do I know which products are best for me?",
