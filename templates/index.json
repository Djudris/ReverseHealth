        "faq-question-1": "What is Wellinda?",
        "faq-answer-1": "We are a women's wellness brand dedicated to supporting all stages of menopause, foundational health, and graceful aging. With our deep understanding of the complex symptoms and challenges of menopause, we offer targeted relief through evidence-based supplements and holistic health protocols. Each ingredient is included at an efficacious dosage, rigorously tested for safety and potency. Wellinda products are designed to empower women to achieve optimal vitality and wellbeing.",
        "faq-question-2": "Why do I need to use supplements?",
        "faq-answer-2": "Supplements provide essential nutrients that are difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities from food alone, especially during life stages such as menopause. For instance, Collagen supplements can help offset the decline in natural collagen production during menopause, offering notable benefits for skin and joint health. While Protein supplements are a practical and convenient way to increase total protein intake, which is known to benefit weight loss, muscle tone and hormonal balance. Wellinda’s supplements, including those specifically for menopause, offer an added layer of support and relief, enhancing overall wellbeing without solely relying on dietary changes. Our Evidence-based products are designed to complement your lifestyle, ensuring optimal health and graceful aging.",
        "faq-question-3": "Are there any side effects?",
        "faq-answer-3": "While our products are designed with a focus on safety and are based on natural ingredients, individual reactions can vary.  Most, if not all, of the products we sell are composed of natural ingredients that can be obtained from targeted diets. We recommend consulting with a healthcare professional before beginning any new supplement regimen, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, have existing health conditions, or are taking other medications.",
